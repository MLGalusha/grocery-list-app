# Grocery List App

A web application that aims to simplify grocery shopping by tracking items, budgets, and real-time prices from various stores. The end goal is to give users a clear estimate of their total cost before they even step foot in a store, helping them avoid surprises at checkout.

## Vision

- **Real-Time Price Comparison**
  Integrate with multiple store APIs (e.g., Walmart) so users can instantly see how much their list will cost at each location.

- **Budget-Friendly Shopping**
  Allow users to set a budget and get alerts when their list exceeds that amount. This way, they can swap out items or remove unnecessary ones to stay on target.

- **Personalized Recommendations**
  Use AI/ML to suggest items or recipes based on purchase history, dietary preferences, or cost-saving opportunities.

- **Future Enhancements**
  - **Meal Planning**: Automatically add ingredients for selected recipes.
  - **Store Mapping**: Provide aisle-by-aisle guidance if store layout data is available.
  - **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Enable offline functionality and a mobile app-like experience without needing to develop a separate native app.

## Why This Project Matters

Grocery shopping can be time-consuming, unpredictable, and stressfulâ€”especially when trying to stick to a budget. This app aims to:

- **Reduce Over-Spending**: Know your total before checkout.
- **Save Time**: Plan your trip and compare prices in one place.
- **Enhance Convenience**: Get tailored suggestions and potentially a smarter route through the store (in future versions).

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves!
