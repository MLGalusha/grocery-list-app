# Grocery Data Aggregator

This repository is part of my Grocery List App project—but the focus has shifted. I’m currently dedicating my efforts to mastering web scraping with Python. The goal is to learn and implement robust scraping techniques to extract real-time data (such as prices, product details, and availability) from major grocery retailers like Walmart, Target, and Aldi. Once I have a reliable scraper, I’ll build a web application around the aggregated data.

## Project Overview

### Phase 1: Web Scraping

- **Objective:**
  Develop a solid, reliable web scraping module that can extract and update grocery data from one or more major retailers.
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Understand the fundamentals of HTTP requests and HTML parsing using libraries like **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup**.
  - Dive deep into browser automation with **Selenium** (including advanced techniques like using Undetected ChromeDriver and Selenium-Stealth) to handle dynamic, JavaScript-driven pages.
  - Learn about anti-bot detection, browser fingerprinting, rotating user-agents, and proxy management.
- **Technologies:**
  Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Undetected ChromeDriver, Selenium-Stealth

### Phase 2: Web Application

- **Objective:**
  Build a website using React and TypeScript that displays and interacts with the scraped data.
- **Features:**
  - Present real-time price comparisons and product data.
  - Allow users to filter, sort, and compare data from different retailers.
  - Potential future integration of AI to provide insights (e.g., predicting price trends).
- **Technologies:**
  React, TypeScript, CSS, and eventually AI libraries as needed.

## Current Status

- **Web Scraping Module:**
  Today, I’m working on refining the web scraper for a major retailer (e.g., Walmart). I’m experimenting with techniques to bypass basic anti-bot measures and ensure the scraper can reliably extract the necessary data.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Expand the scraper to handle additional retailers.
  - Store and organize the scraped data locally.
  - Begin integrating the data with a web interface once the scraper is stable.

## Why This Project?

- **Skill Expansion:**
  Web scraping is a powerful skill that complements web development and AI. Mastering it provides a competitive edge—think of it as a multiplier for your ability to build data-driven applications.
- **Real-World Impact:**
  Aggregating data from multiple sources will enable features like real-time price comparisons, which can be invaluable for users looking to save money or make informed shopping decisions.
- **Career Opportunities:**
  Expertise in web scraping, along with full-stack web development and AI, is highly attractive to employers and can lead to a wide range of projects and job opportunities.
